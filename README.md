# SACM_Project
Volunteer project with Student Advocacy Center of Michigan. Process information from a large database to facilitate directed fundraising campaign. 

## Goal  
The goal of this project is to get a list of potential donors for the Student Advocacy Center of Michigan. The first pass at pairing down a list of potential donors is to see who has donated to the Democratic Party or to a candidate living in Wayne County more than twice or more than $500. If other potential criteria come up, those can also be include to add to/pair down the list further.
